# Data-Analysis-in-Excel
This Excel workbook contains data analysis and data cleaning procedures that I undertook to make a responsive Excel dashboard. The sidebar on the left work and can redirect you to the data analysis sheet where you'll see the steps I took to clean and process the data. I used my knowledge in pivot tables, formatting and Excel formulas to clean and make visual guides for the dashboard. If this workbook helped you don't forget to give it a star and follow me :)
